"""
classification is preferred when dependent variable is a binary quantity.
for multi catogaries it's efficiency is very less

UNSUPERVISED ALGORITHMS
take the case of classification each trusted data is given into training and a function is generated
but in unsupervised learning each object is a training model
we expect a learning curve which is generated from each data entry
there is no predicting here
we analyze patterns of data(clusters)
used in reccomendation algos
duplicacies/frauds,outliers can be found in here

clustering algorithms->
partition based clustering->K-means
hierarchial base->trees
density->arbitary shapes *good when there is spatial datasets
